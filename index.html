               <h3>Myself and two other UIUX FE dev students, Andrew Grant & Erica Berkshire, formulated The WasteAway IOS app idea . We felt that the lack of knowledge and information surrounding recycling was scarce. After researching what was available on the app store, it became apparent that not only is recycling and waste a global issue, but there simply aren’t resources available to help consumers know how to recycle properly. We wanted to provide a place for information that was useful, easy to understand and easy to use.</h3>
               <h3>Through user intervies and survey we were able to narrow down  how consumers felt about recylicing and the  resources available. We used our data. to create an affinity diagram highlighting the users experience with recycling. From there we created an empathy map that allowed us to identify the key areas  and feelings consumers were facing during their recycling experience. This informed our persona, who felt frustrated with the lack of ability to recycle effectively. She wanted an easily solution to sort through recycling and an easier way  to know what is and isn't recyclable. Our persona helped us define our app features because we were able to address her key concerns as a use. We know each state has specific recycling laws and regulations, so our app highlighted recycling in Oregon. On further development we'd like to feature other geographic locations and additional Features.</h3>
               <h3>WasteAway helps people who feel frustrated with the complexity of recycling by providing an app with tools and resources to help users recycle correctly.
                We know that people want to be good stewards of the environment and make an effort to recycle but the different rules and regulations that vary from city to city create barriers to entry. WasteAway tells you exactly what kind of material you have and where it goes based on your area's specific recycling requirements. Waste Away also provides users with resources to their local collection services and other sustainability organizations.
                Stop wasting time and effort trying to figure out what goes in the recycling bin or the trash.
                WasteAway: Recycle right.</h3>
                <h3>Based on feedback from our mid-fidelity prototype, we started building out our hi-fidelity prototype. During this process, we continued iterating on the page design and user flow using A/B testing.

                    We created different versions of the loading screen after a user takes a photo. We tested different versions of the home screen layouts also.
                    
                    We also tested the content hierarchy of different card layouts.</h3>
                    <h3>The initial prototype, before iterations included cards for different sections we expected to be difficulties for consumers. And, areas we wish to address.
 
                        After developing the style of our product, we began adding stylistic decisions to our mid-fidelity prototype. We designed with a flexbox framework in mind so that it’d be easy to align content and make it compatible on different smartphone screen sizes.
                        
                        Translating the Figma design into css had some compatibility issues which we made great progress toward cleaning up in later iterations.</h3>
